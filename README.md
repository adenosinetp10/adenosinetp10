Hello there! I'm adenosinetp10 from Tamil Nadu, India currently pursuing my Batchelors in Information technology. It's been 18 years since I was born. Spent most of my time watching Anime and playing Games. I was a former Biology Student in my High school(doesn't mean I have no interest in Biology now). Always had keen interest in Computers since childhood. My fav Anime Character : The King of Heroes , The Wielder of Ea, the one and only GILGAMESH! My fave Anime : There's a lot, but I'm mostly into Mystery, Thriller, Action, Adventure.
